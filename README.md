# Refactoring Agent

This project is an AI-powered agent that runs overnight to pull a repository,
examine the code for best practices, and make necessary refactorings that follow
best practices. It is designed to simplify code and increase developer productivity
and maintainability without introducing bugs or breaking changes.

## How It Works

1. **Repository Update**: The agent clones or pulls the latest changes from the specified repository.
2. **Code Analysis**: The agent analyzes the codebase for potential improvements.
3. **Refactoring**: The agent applies suggestions to refactor the code, ensuring that no breaking changes or bugs are introduced.

## Getting Started

1. Install dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
2. Configure the repository URL in `config.py`.
3. Run the agent:
    ```bash
    python main.py
    ```

## What Makes CodeHuskAI Unique?

CodeHuskAI differentiates itself from other AI refactoring tools by leveraging advanced LLM capabilities to provide:

* **LLM-Driven Insights:** Unlike traditional rule-based systems, CodeHuskAI utilizes state-of-the-art language models (e.g., GPT-3.5 Turbo)
  to generate context-aware, human-like suggestions tailored to the code it analyzes.

* **Safe, Non-Invasive Modifications:** Refactorings are crafted to be non-breaking. CodeHuskAI focuses on improvements that enhance maintainability without introducing new bugs.

* **Modular & Extensible Architecture:** With a clean separation between repository management, code analysis, and refactoring logic, the project
  can be easily extended to integrate additional tools (like AST transformations or custom linters) as needed.

* **Seamless DevOps Integration:** Out-of-the-box Dockerization, container orchestration, and scheduling support allow CodeHuskAI to fit
  neatly into CI/CD pipelines and automated development workflows.

* **Developer Productivity Focus:** By automating repetitive refactoring tasks and prioritizing changes based on impact,
  developers can focus more on writing new features and less on manual code cleanup.

## Notes

- This is initial scaffolding code. Further integration with actual static analysis and refactoring tools is needed.
- The current implementation only simulates refactorings by logging suggestions.
