# Refactoring Agent

This project is an AI-powered agent that runs overnight to pull a repository,
examine the code for best practices, and make necessary refactorings that follow
best practices. It is designed to simplify code and increase developer productivity
and maintainability without introducing bugs or breaking changes.

## How It Works

1. **Repository Update**: The agent clones or pulls the latest changes from the specified repository.
2. **Code Analysis**: The agent analyzes the codebase for potential improvements.
3. **Refactoring**: The agent applies suggestions to refactor the code, ensuring that no breaking changes or bugs are introduced.

## Getting Started

1. Install dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
2. Configure the repository URL in `config.py`.
3. Run the agent:
    ```bash
    python main.py
    ```

## Notes

- This is initial scaffolding code. Further integration with actual static analysis and refactoring tools is needed.
- The current implementation only simulates refactorings by logging suggestions.
